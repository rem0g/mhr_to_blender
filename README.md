See issue to SAM Body 3D: https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-body/issues/53 about remapping issues between mhr_parameters.npz and lod0.fbx from MHR https://github.com/facebookresearch/MHR

.glb file consisting of PLY meshes: https://signcollect.nl/mhr/animated_body.glb - so no rigged model, it's 100% mesh which makes it large. 160 frames * 1.5 MB of mesh per frame. 

See my attempt to map mhr_parameters to rigged MHR character: https://signcollect.nl/mhr/mhr_animated.blend
